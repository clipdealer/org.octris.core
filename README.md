# Octris PHP Framework

## Preface

This is a BSD licensed PHP framework (please see LICENSE file supplied with this repository
for details). This framework is a work in progress and parts of it may change in future.

## Documentation

* Source documentation (nightly update): http://doc.octris.org/org.octris.core/

## Requirements

It's higly recommended to use this framework in a UN*X environment, like for example Linux and Mac OS X, 
because the framework makes use of lot's of tools and system-characteristics found on these systems. 
The framework is developed and tested using Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris (Sparc64), so you should not have 
any problems to use it on either of these operating systems.

The framework requires: 

*   PHP 5.6.x
*   GNU make

## PHP and extensions

The following PHP extensions are required. Without them, the framework might not work properly or 
even not at all:

*   yaml (http://pecl.php.net/package/yaml)
*   bcmath
*   gettext
*   intl
*   mbstring

The following PHP extensions are highly recommended, but not required to be installed. The core 
framework will work perfectly without them:

*   mcrypt
*   readline
